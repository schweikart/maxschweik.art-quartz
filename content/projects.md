I enjoy contributing to open source projects in my personal time.
If you've ever had a programming project yourself, you'll know that most projects never see the light of day before they are discontinued.
Consequently, only projects that are somewhat complete made it to this page.
If you would like to contribute to any of my projects, feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the respective GitHub site!

## Pirates O-Week Website 🏴‍☠️
*Oct 2022*

I'm involved in the organization of the mathmatics and computer science o-week
at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/).
With a bunch of friends, we're welcoming about one hundred students to the
university and to the city, which is still just a small fraction of the new
students that come to Karlsruhe each year.
We've had a simple website for a long time but for this year's o-week we wanted
to ramp up the design, usability and content of the site.
Inspired by Matthew Wagerfield's and Claudio Guglieri's awesome
[parallax.js](https://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) library (and the
accompanying site!), I
[sketched out](/projects/pirates-o-week-sketch.jpg){external=true} some ideas
for the layout and style of the site.
Together with my friend and co-organizer [Philipp](https://philipp-seidel.de/),
we refined the idea and implemented it within three days (!).
We used a lot of free photos and vector images from the internet and Philipp
created some awesome musty, pirate-y and wooden artwork that we could use.
I'm really happy with how it turned out, you should definitely

## This Website
*Jun 2022 - today*

I've built this website on top of [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) with the [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the [content-wind](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind) template.
I have thought about different design ideas for my website for a long time but since I've never found the time to fully prepare those first, I am now building on top of an existing solution as a start.

## Arminius
*Jan 2022*

> Drag and Drop Germanes to mightily surprise Romans. 
> Inspired by the battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

As a team of four students, all new to game development, we took part in the [Historically Accurate Game Jam 5](https://itch.io/jam/historically-accurate-5).
The theme of the game jam was "Your country's history", so we had to come up with ideas for a fun little game that depicts some part of Germany's long past.
"Arminius" is a game inspired by the battle of the Teutoburg Forest between the Germanes and the Roman Empire.

## Tic Tac Toe on Cloudflare Workers
*Sep 2021*

Tic Tac Toe is a classic minigame that is often used as an introductory excercise to learning a new programming language or technology.
As part of the [Cloudflare Developer Summer Challenge 2021](https://blog.cloudflare.com/developer-summer-challenge/),
I implemented an online Tic Tac Toe game on top of their [Workers platform](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
Although it was a hassle to work with some their bleeding-edge tools, this implementation was a fun experiment and I enjoy drinking from the mug that Cloudflare sent me for my participation :)

## SafeMarket
*Mar 2020*

> SafeMarket offers you a digital reservation service that minimizes queues and infections, so that we can continue to shop safely during the corona pandemic.

In March 2020, I took part in the "[WirVsVirus](https://wirvsvirus.org/hackaton/)" hackathon that was hosted by the German federal government.
The hackathon's goal was to prototype digital solutions to the problems that had already become apparent in this early stage of the pandemic.
At the time, most grocery stores, post offices and other public places were subject to access restrictions by law.
So, in a team of more than twenty strangers, we built a slot-based reservation platform for visiting these places.

Stores owners could register at our site, customize the business hours of their stores and tell us how many people they wanted in their stores concurrently.
Customers could then find their favourite stores on a map and book a shopping slot as they wished.
A doorman could verify the booking through a QR code so that the customer would never have to submit any personal data to the store.

## Pseudonymous projects
*2014 - today*

I'm using the alias "traxam" to contribute to non-academic projects that target larger communities.

My interest in programming started with developing plugins for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) servers using the [Bukkit](https://minecraftservers.fandom.com/wiki/Bukkit) platform when I was 13 years old.
Back then, I didn't release my software to proper marketplaces but you can find most of the source code that is somewhat usable on my pseudonymous [GitHub](https://github.com/made-by-traxam) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/traxam) profiles.

Some years later, I gathered interest in developing useful bots for [Discord](https://discord.com/).
In a team with five strangers from the internet, we developed the [Rubicon](https://github.com/Rubicon-Bot/Rubicon) Discord bot which could play music in voice calls, help server owners moderate chat and provide useful data to all kinds of users.
Discord bots were still somewhat new and at peak, our bot was in contact with a more than 100,000 users and 1,000 servers.
Unfortunately, none of us knew how to maintain and scale projects at this scale so we had to discontinue it in summer 2018.

In December 2018, I started working on a website for the modding community of the survival game [Raft](https://raft-game.com/).
I had developed [a couple of useful mods](https://www.raftmodding.com/user/traxam) for the game but they could only be shared through a phpBB forum ([snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20190704234427/https://www.raftmodding.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=3)) which I found quite unappealing.
After some initial disputes with the programmer of the community's mod loader, my website became the standard for discovering new mods for the game.
Today, [the website](https://www.raftmodding.com/) manages software releases of the mod loader and is used by dozens of mod creators to distribute their modifications.
It has been visited by more than 450,000 unique users and served more than 3.3 million mod downloads and 490,000 mod loader downloads.
I am still maintaining the website and a [new version](https://github.com/raftmodding/web-monorepo) has been in the works for over a year now.
