<!-- TODO: add profile picture -->

I'm Max, a computer science graduate and [quantum computing](/tags/quantum) nerd.
I've recently graduated from the [University of Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk) and I
will soon begin working as a research assistant in quantum computing and
computer science at [KIT](https://kit.edu).
This website is home to many of the things I am working on, just to put them out
there in case they may be useful to someone else at some point.
Take a look around and let me know if you could use my stuff for anything cool! :)
