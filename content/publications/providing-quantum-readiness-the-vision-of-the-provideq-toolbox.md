In this paper, we introduce our vision for the
[ProvideQ Toolbox](/projects/provideq), a software tool for facilitating the
integration of efficient quantum algorithms into existing software stacks.

# Abstract
> Quantum computing has the potential to exponentially accelerate the solution
> of specific problems compared to classical computing.
> However, the accessibility to quantum computing is currently limited due to
> the technical challenges posed by quantum devices.
> Additionally, implementing quantum algorithms is challenging because of the
> complex nature of quantum systems.
> To address these challenges, we introduce the ProvideQ Toolbox, a framework
> designed to enhance the accessibility of quantum computing, especially for
> optimization problems.
> Our toolbox includes a range of classical and quantum state-of-the-art
> optimization algorithms and employs meta-solver strategies to determine the
> best quantum optimization algorithm or quantum subroutine in a classical
> algorithm for a given optimization problem.
> The ProvideQ Toolbox can be used via a web-based frontend and an API and can
> be seamlessly integrated with multiple quantum computing backends and
> classical optimization frameworks.
