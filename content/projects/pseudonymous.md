I'm using the alias "traxam" to contribute to non-academic projects that target larger communities.

My interest in programming started with developing plugins for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) servers using the [Bukkit](https://minecraftservers.fandom.com/wiki/Bukkit) platform when I was 13 years old.
Back then, I didn't release my software to proper marketplaces but you can find most of the source code that is somewhat usable on my pseudonymous [GitHub](https://github.com/made-by-traxam) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/traxam) profiles.

Some years later, I gathered interest in developing useful bots for [Discord](https://discord.com/).
In a team with five strangers from the internet, we developed the [Rubicon](https://github.com/Rubicon-Bot/Rubicon) Discord bot which could play music in voice calls, help server owners moderate chat and provide useful data to all kinds of users.
Discord bots were still somewhat new and at peak, our bot was in contact with a more than 100,000 users and 1,000 servers.
Unfortunately, none of us knew how to maintain and scale projects at this scale so we had to discontinue it in summer 2018.

In December 2018, I started working on a website for the modding community of the survival game [Raft](https://raft-game.com/).
I had developed [a couple of useful mods](https://www.raftmodding.com/user/traxam) for the game but they could only be shared through a phpBB forum ([snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20190704234427/https://www.raftmodding.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=3)) which I found quite unappealing.
After some initial disputes with the programmer of the community's mod loader, my website became the standard for discovering new mods for the game.
Today, [the website](https://www.raftmodding.com/) manages software releases of the mod loader and is used by dozens of mod creators to distribute their modifications.
It has been visited by more than 450,000 unique users and served more than 3.3 million mod downloads and 490,000 mod loader downloads.
I am still maintaining the website and a [new version](https://github.com/raftmodding/web-monorepo) has been in the works for over a year now.
