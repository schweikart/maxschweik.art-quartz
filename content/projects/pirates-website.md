I'm involved in the organization of the mathmatics and computer science o-week
at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/).
With a bunch of friends, we're welcoming about one hundred students to the
university and to the city, which is still just a small fraction of the new
students that come to Karlsruhe each year.
We've had a simple website for a long time but for this year's o-week we wanted
to ramp up the design, usability and content of the site.
Inspired by Matthew Wagerfield's and Claudio Guglieri's awesome
[parallax.js](https://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) library (and the
accompanying site!), I
[sketched out](/projects/pirates-o-week-sketch.jpg){external=true} some ideas
for the layout and style of the site.
Together with my friend and co-organizer [Philipp](https://philipp-seidel.de/),
we refined the idea and implemented it within three days (!).
We used a lot of free photos and vector images from the internet and Philipp
created some awesome musty, pirate-y and wooden artwork that we could use.
I'm really happy with how it turned out, you should definitely
