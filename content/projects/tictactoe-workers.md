Tic Tac Toe is a classic minigame that is often used as an introductory excercise to learning a new programming language or technology.
As part of the [Cloudflare Developer Summer Challenge 2021](https://blog.cloudflare.com/developer-summer-challenge/),
I implemented an online Tic Tac Toe game on top of their [Workers platform](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
Although it was a hassle to work with some their bleeding-edge tools, this implementation was a fun experiment and I enjoy drinking from the mug that Cloudflare sent me for my participation :)
