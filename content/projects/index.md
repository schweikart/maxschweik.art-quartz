I enjoy contributing to open source projects in my personal time.
If you've ever had a programming project yourself, you'll know that most projects never see the light of day before they are discontinued.
Consequently, only projects that are somewhat complete made it to this page.
If you would like to contribute to any of my projects, feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the respective GitHub site!
