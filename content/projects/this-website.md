I've built this website on top of [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) with the [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the [content-wind](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind) template.
I have thought about different design ideas for my website for a long time but since I've never found the time to fully prepare those first, I am now building on top of an existing solution as a start.
