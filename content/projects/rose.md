ROSE is a graphical road system editor used to set up highway networks that can
be exported to traffic simulation software.
It was created as a group project in the
["Praxis der Softwareentwicklung" (Software Engineering Practice)](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/lehre/WS202122/pse/?lang=en)
course at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
The goal of PSE is to build a useful application using the
[waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model).
