> SafeMarket offers you a digital reservation service that minimizes queues and infections, so that we can continue to shop safely during the corona pandemic.

In March 2020, I took part in the "[WirVsVirus](https://wirvsvirus.org/hackaton/)" hackathon that was hosted by the German federal government.
The hackathon's goal was to prototype digital solutions to the problems that had already become apparent in this early stage of the pandemic.
At the time, most grocery stores, post offices and other public places were subject to access restrictions by law.
So, in a team of more than twenty strangers, we built a slot-based reservation platform for visiting these places.

Stores owners could register at our site, customize the business hours of their stores and tell us how many people they wanted in their stores concurrently.
Customers could then find their favourite stores on a map and book a shopping slot as they wished.
A doorman could verify the booking through a QR code so that the customer would never have to submit any personal data to the store.
