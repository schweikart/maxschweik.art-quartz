> Drag and Drop Germanes to mightily surprise Romans. 
> Inspired by the battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

As a team of four students, all new to game development, we took part in the [Historically Accurate Game Jam 5](https://itch.io/jam/historically-accurate-5).
The theme of the game jam was "Your country's history", so we had to come up with ideas for a fun little game that depicts some part of Germany's long past.
"Arminius" is a game inspired by the battle of the Teutoburg Forest between the Germanes and the Roman Empire.
