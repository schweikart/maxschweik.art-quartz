With quantum algorithms, we can solve problems like prime factorization faster
than with any known classical (non-quantum) algorithm.
However, quantum computers are just becoming available to the public - and
they're hard to program!
The programming frameworks for quantum computers available today are similar to
writing assembler code for classical computers and in addition you have to know
your quantum mechanics to some extent.

With the tooling still in early development, it is hard to harness the power of
quantum computers today without having to become an expert in the field.
**ProvideQ** tackles this obstacle through a web service that allows solving
common problems in computer science like the SATisfiability problem.
Problems instances submitted to the ProvideQ toolbox will be solved either with
a classical or a quantum problem solver, depending the problem and what
available quantum computers are capable of.

# Publications
We have published several papers on the toolbox.
As an introductory read, I can recommend our most recent paper which gives a
good overview over the motivation, theory and implementation of the toolbox. 
* [ProvideQ: A Quantum Optimization Toolbox](/publications/provideq-a-quantum-optimization-toolbox) (2025)
* [Hybrid Meta-Solving for Practical Quantum Computing](/publications/hybrid-meta-solving-for-practical-quantum-computing) (2024)
* [Providing Quantum Readiness: The Vision of the ProvideQ Toolbox](/publications/providing-quantum-readiness-the-vision-of-the-provideq-toolbox.md) (2023)
